# Classification Predicitive Modeling | Apprentice Chef

Objective: Build a Machine Learning algortihm to predict customers who will subscribe to one of the service from Apprentice Chef called Halfway There service.


Machine Learning methods:

i. Predict the TARGET variable CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS. There are a number of variables provided to support the prediction, i.e: Revenue, Total Meals Order, Weekly Meal Plan, etc. Out of 29 columns, 4 are categorical and 25 are numerical.

ii. Feature engineering with collinearity by finding relationships between multiple predictors at once or called as multi-collinearity. Other techniques was by setting a certain threshold from analyzing the shape of the data.

iii. Data scaling and model tuning to optimize accuracy.



Choosing between models:

i. Start with several models that are interpretable and most flexible.

ii. Consider using the simplest model that reasonably approximates the best performance.

iii. Intepret the result.
